# Namespace Brutal.ImGuiAPI

> **Namespace:** `Brutal.ImGuiAPI`  
> **Assembly:** `Brutal.ImGui.dll`

The Namespace `Brutual.ImGuiAPI` is Brutal's implementation of an Immediate-mode Graphical user interface (ImGui). 

An Immediate-mode Graphical user interface is characterized as a Graphical User Interface "in which user code directly specifies the GUI elements to draw in the user input loop. For example, rather than having a CreateButton() function that a user would call once to instantiate a button, an immediate-mode GUI API may have a DoButton() function which should be called whenever the button should be on screen." (Wikipedia, 'Immediate Mode (computer graphics), 11/20/2025) [^1]

This current page will go over the very basics of creating a Brutal ImGui Window. The other GUI elements will have their respective pages which you can find in the section viewer.

## Creating Your First Window

### Prerequisites

All of the ImGui elements must be drawn to the screen every frame and as such, their code should be executed every frame. It is recommened to put the code in a function that is called every frame.

For StarMap an example setup for the ImGui would be,

```csharp
using Brutal.ImGuiAPI;
using StarMap.API;

[StarMapMod]
public class ImGuiExample
{
    [StarMapAfterGui]
    public void AfterGUI()
    {
        // ImGui code or function calls go here
    }
}
```

To learn more about how StarMap handles drawing GUI, check out the StarMap GitHub page or join the KSA Discord to ask questions.

### Methods

* `bool ImGui.Begin(string id, [ImGuiWindowFlags flags = ImGuiWindowFlags.None])`
* `void ImGui.End()`
* `bool ImGui.Begin(string id, ref bool pOpen, [ImGuiWindowFlags flags = ImGuiWindowFlags.None])`

### My First Window

The simplest and most important part of an ImGui application is the window. This is what all of your elements will show up in. To start, every window requires an `ImGui.Begin()` and `ImGui.End()` method to be called. If either of these are not called you will get a RunTime error. 

To create a window all you need to do is add this small piece of code.

```csharp
if(ImGui.Begin("My First Window")) {}
ImGui.End();
```

> Advanced Explanation: We put the `ImGui.Begin()` inside an if-statement because the method returns `true` if successfully drawn to the screen, and we only want to add any element inside the if-statement only if the window was successfully drawn. The `ImGui.End()` is outside the if-statement as we always want to end the window at somepoint in our code.

This will create a Empty Window with the title `My First Window`. 

![alt text](<First Window.png>)

Which can also be collapsed,

![alt text](<Collapsed Window.png>)

This window is also resizable in both the horizontal and vertical,

![alt text](<Resized Window.png>)

### Closeable Window

One thing to notice is that `My First Window` is not fully closeable, it can be collapsed but not closed. To change this, we can add a boolean reference to our `ImGui.Begin()`.

```csharp
private bool showWindow = true;

[StarMapAfterGui]
public void AfterGUI()
{
    if(!showWindow) return;

    if(ImGui.Begin("My First Window", ref showWindow)) {}
    ImGui.End();
}
```

> The reason that the `bool showWindow` is outside the `AfterGui()` is that we want the boolean for showing the window to not get reset every frame, we want to preserve it in-between frames.

> The `if(!showWindow) return;` line is required to hide the window, because the window will be drawn every frame if its code is executed, even if the boolean reference is false.

And the window will now look like this.

![alt text](<Closeable Window.png>)

You can now see that there is an `X` button at the top right of the window and when pressed the window is fully closed.

![alt text](<Closed Window.png>)

Not very much to see there now.

!!! warning "Unable to Reopen Window"
    You must add a way to change the `showWindow` value if you want the window to reopen. More will be added later for this.

### Customizing the Window

To further customize your ImGui window, you can use `ImGuiWindowFlags`. These are ways to specify what you want your window to be or how to behave. If you want all the information on each of the flags, visit the ImGuiWindowFlags page.

!!! warning "Page Not Created"
    As of 11/20/2025, the time this page was created, the ImGuiWindowFlags page does not exist. Sorry about that.

By default, the `ImGui.Begin()` method has a `ImGuiWindowFlags` flag value of `None`.

> Reminder of the Constructors

> * `bool ImGui.Begin(string id, [ImGuiWindowFlags flags = ImGuiWindowFlags.None])`

> * `bool ImGui.Begin(string id, ref bool pOpen, [ImGuiWindowFlags flags = ImGuiWindowFlags.None])`

This flag value just specifies that we don't want any special characteristics for our window. We have already been using this value by default for our window.

We will now use two new flag values, `NoResize` and `NoTitleBar`. These flags can be created and put into the `ImGui.Begin()` as such.

```csharp
private bool showWindow = true;

[StarMapAfterGui]
public void AfterGUI()
{
    if(!showWindow) return;

    ImGuiWindowFlags flags = ImGuiWindowFlags.NoResize | ImGuiWindowFlags.NoTitleBar;
    if(ImGui.Begin("My First Window", ref showWindow, flags)) {}
    ImGui.End();
}
```

> The reason we can use `ImGuiWindowFlags.NoResize | ImGuiWindowFlags.NoTitleBar` in setting our flags is because each flag corresponds to a bit in an integer, thus acting as a boolean. When a bitwise OR operation `|` is performed on them, it just adds all the active bits to the final value, thus telling the method which flags are true.

The window should now have no title and not be resizable.

![alt text](<Customized Window.png>)

> You can tell the window is not resizable as it does not have the small blue triangle in the bottom right corner of the window.

As a result of not having a title bar the window is no longer collapsible through the drop-down arrow, nor is it closeable using the `X` button.

### Common Errors

Below are some common errors that you may experience when creating a window.

![alt text](<Missing End Error.png>)

> This error appears when you are missing `ImGui.End()` in your code or it is in an unreachable state. One common mistake is putting the `ImGui.End()` inside the if-statement that your `ImGui.Begin()` is the conditional for. Another common mistake is not having enough `ImGui.End()` statements as each unique `Begin()` statement must match up with one unique `End()` statement.  

![alt text](<Calling End Too Many Times.png>)

> This error appears when you are missing `ImGui.Begin()` in your code or it is in an unreachable state. One common mistake is having too many `ImGui.End()` statements as each unique `Begin()` statement must match up with one unique `End()` statement.

### Conclusion

Now that you know how to make your first window, you can explore the other ImGui pages to see how you can add to your window.

If you want to learn more and practice with ImGui while you wait for the `Brutal.ImGuiAPI` pages to be created, the link below will take you to an example project that shows the code it runs as you explore the example.
